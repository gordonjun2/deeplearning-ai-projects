      "\n",
      "4. **Alternative Data Source**: If `yfinance` continues to fail, consider using another service or library like `Alpha Vantage` or `IEX Cloud` that also provide historical stock data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please proceed with these troubleshooting steps or adjust the configuration to try fetching the data again. If issues persist, we might need to consider a different approach for obtaining the data or select an alternative timeframe where data is definitely available.\n",

      "Given the repeated issues with fetching stock price data directly via the `yfinance` Python library, I suggest you confirm Nvidia's stock data availability via a reliable financial website like Yahoo Finance or Google Finance. This can be done by navigating to these websites and manually checking if the data for the specified timeframe (or any other recent timeframe) is available. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s how you can do it:\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Alternative Data Source**: If `yfinance` continues to fail, consider using another service or library like `Alpha Vantage` or `IEX Cloud` that also provide historical stock data.\n",

      "Given the repeated issues with fetching stock price data directly via the `yfinance` Python library, I suggest you confirm Nvidia's stock data availability via a reliable financial website like Yahoo Finance or Google Finance. This can be done by navigating to these websites and manually checking if the data for the specified timeframe (or any other recent timeframe) is available. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s how you can do it:\n",
